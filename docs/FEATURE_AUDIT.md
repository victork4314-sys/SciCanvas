- **Project default font and apply-to-all-text:** Implemented.
- **Embedding imported font binaries in project/PowerPoint exports:** Not implemented; imported fonts remain device-local.
- **Species-name italic style helper:** Implemented.
- **Scientific metadata fields:** Implemented.
- **Equation editor, chemical notation, superscript/subscript, and automatic gene/protein rules:** Not implemented.
- **Labels physically attached to arbitrary objects:** Not implemented as a dedicated object relationship.

## Templates and interface

## Next priority areas

1. Browser-level interaction tests and automated deployment verification.
2. Account-based encrypted cloud storage.
3. Grouping, multi-selection, SVG node editing, masks, Boolean operations, and richer vector editing.
4. Native editable PowerPoint-object export.
5. Equations, chemical notation, and scientific text rules.
6. A normalized import pipeline for additional licensed packs.
7. Collaborative lab workspaces, comments, and review history.
8. Accessible figure descriptions and standards-based pathway export.
